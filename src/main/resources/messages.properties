defaultTaskDescription=Data Points: {0}\
  \ Initial centroids: {1}.<br>\
  \ Perform the k-means algorithm on the given {2} data points by assigning them to the {3} clusters.<br>\
  \ Use the {4} distance for your calculations.<br>\
  \ The formula for the {4} distance is: {5}.<br>\
  \ Use the format [(x,y): A,B,...]; [(x,y): C,D,...],\
  \ where (x,y) represents the cluster center and the points after the colon are the data points assigned to that cluster.<br>\
  \ Clusters within an iteration are separated by semicolon ;.<br>\
  \ Multiple iterations must be separated by a line containing only two dashes: `--`.<br>\
  \ Use dots . as decimal separators. The order of the clusters is arbitrary.<br>\
  \ Example:<br>\
  \ [(36.89,50.50): J]; [(40.78,41.84): B, D]<br>\
  \ --<br>\
  \ [(38.84,49.70): B, J]; [(35.90,43.20): D]<br>\
  \ --<br>\
  \ [(37.30,47.60): B, J]; [(33.80,44.10): D]<br>\
  \ {6} <br>\
  \ Note: The first and last iteration are worth fewer points, as the main focus is on the intermediate steps of the clustering process.
